#### Connect With Your Future

### User Story

As of today's circumnstances due to COVID-19 virus, few events are prepared to effectively deliver the experience we, as atendees, are used to receive. Everythin's often confusing and messy because of the high number of participants, and it's quite more difficult to methodicaly organize conferences and meetings within this specter. As participants it's not easy to understand which companies are interested in you, with whom should you aim to connect, or even how to find key individuals that also partake on the event in social media. As companies, it's hard to navigate through an overwhelming sea of participants, and filtering all the relevant information can prove to be a daunting challenge.

So we want to facilitate the entire process by showing the user who is participating on a given online conference (within a certain even), as well as all the companies present; mediate connections between participants and conferencees; and overall smoothen information filtering for both sides. All this to provide a cleaner, more organized experience for everyone envolved in those events.
