## Product Vision

Neftfair is an app designed to provide a simple and elegant solution to networking at online events, such as carreer fairs, tech fairs, etc.
Empowered by sorting and filtering algorithms in a clean, oranized and user friendly UI, both companies and participants can interact together or comunicate with each other seamlessly, and view each others relevant information in a structured fashion using the apps features and functionalities.

---

## Elevator Pitch

As of today's circumnstances due to COVID-19 virus, few events are prepared to effectively deliver the experience we, as atendees, are used to receive. Everything's often confusing and messy because of the high number of participants, and it's quite more difficult to methodicaly organize conferences and meetings within this specter. As **participants** it's not easy to understand which companies are interested in you, with whom should you aim to connect, or even how to find key individuals that also partake on the event in social media. As **companies**, it's hard to navigate through an overwhelming sea of participants, and filtering all the relevant information can prove to be a daunting challenge.

So we want to facilitate the entire process by showing the user who is participating on a given online conference (within a certain event), as well as all the companies present; mediate connections between participants and conferencees; and overall smoothen information filtering for both sides. All this to provide a cleaner, more organized experience for everyone envolved in those events.

---

## Requirements

### Functional requirements

* Users can be divided into 3 groups: Companies, Participants, and Organizers. Each group can be given separate rights (i.e. Organizers can create and post new events).
* Search option given to user to search users from various events.
* Search option given to user to search for a given event.
* Share option to share a certain event across diferent platforms.
* Calendarization feature to schedule and keep track of incoming events.
* Users can choose to participate in an event from within the app, it being add to their events schedule.
* Links and anchors to relevant external platforms (i.e. social media profiles)
* Users can updload their CV into their profile

### Non-functional requirements

* Participants and Companies never allowed to edit events information.
* Participants and Companies have to be givven an access code upon entering a new event.
* The software should be portable. So moving from one OS to other OS does not create any problem.
* It should be capable enough to handle 100 000 users without affecting its performance.
* Users must complete their profile before navigating through the events.
* New users must choose their user group (Participant, Company, Organization) before navingating through the app.
* Users can change their user group at any time in the settings menu.

### User interface requirements

* Easy to operate
* Quick in response
* Effectively handling operational errors
* Providing simple yet consistent user interface
* User friendly, unnecessary user interactions should be avoided.
* Extensibility and modularity, interoperable across a wide variety of platforms, media types and networks
* Efficient in terms of both speed and user interaction.

7           | Create event      | Generic User  | Med        |

#### Case ID 1 - Creates profile

**Actor:** Generic User.

**Description:** A user will have to create a user profile containing their personal information, like their name, location, phone number, link to LinkedIn, brief description of themselves, etc. Both companies and participants have to create their profile, nevertheless as for the participants there is a public area containing the above mentioned information, and a private one containing information directed only at companies so only companies will be able to see that part of the participants's profile.

**Preconditions and Postconditions:** First, the user must choose to be either a compay or a participant. In order to create a profile the user needs to register. To register they need to input their name, email/phone number and a password. After registering and loging into the app, the user needs to file a form with profile information and after they submit the form the profile will be created and saved in a database. The login information can be saved onto the device after one usage.

**Normal Flow:** After opening the app there will be a login form. If the user already has login credentials he may fill the form fields: email/phone number and password; and hit enter to access the full app. If they don't have the credentials, they must register with their email, phone number and password and then do the steps above to enter. After loging in for the first time in the app, the user will be redirected to a profile screen where there will be a form with multiple fields that the user will have to fill and then tap on a button to save the changes.

**Alternative Flows and Exceptions:** Mandatory fields not filled will occur in an error upon saving. Incorrect filling of certain fields will also result in an error. Errors will display as a message on the screen and saves will not happen.

#### Case ID 2 - Adds an event

**Actor:** Generic User.

**Description:** Each user has to add what events they are taking part of from a selection of events covered in a list on the app. That way, each event has a list of participants and companies atending it making filtering of information a lot easier, more practical and organized.

**Preconditions and Postconditions:** User must be registered and logged in. Once you add a certain event, have full access to the events features within the app, and it shall appear on each individual user's profile.  After adding an event, user will be promped with a success message.

**Normal Flow:** Users must double tap on an event to add it to their attending event list, enter the correspondent event code, and once done successfully it appears on their user profile. For security measures,this event code is given by the organization staff of the event.

**Alternative Flows and Exceptions:** If the event code is invalid, a message will appear on screen telling the user it is already full and te addition to their individual event list won't happen.

#### Case ID 3 - Browses event

**Actor:** Generic User.

**Description:** The user of NetFair has the ability to browse for events and into them, being totaly able to see what events are going on and who's attending what, and even filter that information by categories and order participants, companies and even events. There's even a feature to show/hide participants in an event.

**Preconditions and Postconditions:** User must be registered and logged in. List of events available after filtering, or

**Normal Flow:** Users can navigate through their events or find events within the app, filtering them by name,categories, or datetime. If the user taps on a given event in their event list they will open the correspondent event screen. On that new screen there will appear a schedule of the meetings and pannels that will occurr, and the user will be able to navigate through all the participants and companies attending it. If the user chooses to tap on the participant/company they will open their public profile, where they can see their info, message them, and more.

**Alternative Flows and Exceptions:** If no event corresponds to the search, then a message will appear, and no events will be shown.

#### Case ID 4 - Finds on LinkedIn

**Actor:** Generic User.

**Description:** Both participants of an event and companies attending it will want to find each other on LinkedIn, and currently it can become a long and hard task. NetFair makes finding for connections on LinkedIn look like a walk in the park due to it's in-built system. That way when a participant wants to add some other participant to their LinkedIn network, or even a company, or vice-versa, they can within the tap of a button.

**Preconditions and Postconditions:** User must be registered and logged in. Opens LinkedIn app on the given user's profile.

**Normal Flow:** Tap the button "Find on LinkedIn" to open the LinkedIn app on the given user profile.

**Alternative Flows and Exceptions:** The user does not have a LinkedIn profile, in which case the button will appear in a different color, indicating it's disabled. The user does not have the LinkedIn app installed, in which case they will be redirected to the app store on the LinkedIn install page.

#### Case ID 5 - Has interested in

**Actor:** Company.

**Description:** A company attending an event will often have the desire to  a given participant they think has potential. So they will contact the person they are interested in privatelly and talk to them within the grounds of the application, and the participant will know that the company has an interest in them.

**Preconditions and Postconditions:** User must be registered and logged in. User will be notified of a certain company's interest. An email will be sent to a partcipant whose "Interested" button has been clicked on.

### Domain model

![image create profile](images/domain-model.png)

---

## Architecture and Design

The architecture of a software system encompasses the set of key decisions about its overall organization.

A well written architecture document is brief but reduces the amount of time it takes new programmers to a project to understand the code to feel able to make modifications and enhancements.

To document the architecture requires describing the decomposition of the system in their parts (high-level components) and the key behaviors and collaborations between them.

In this section you should start by briefly describing the overall components of the project and their interrelations. You should also describe how you solved typical problems you may have encountered, pointing to well-known architectural and design patterns, if applicable.

### Logical architecture

The purpose of this subsection is to document the high-level logical structure of the code, using a UML diagram with logical packages, without the worry of allocating to components, processes or machines.

For this purpose we have divided the project into 4 sections:

* Models: Models for each structure of the database. Communications between firebase database and the structures mentioned before.
* Components: This module contains the code for certain components of the app, for example the navigation bar, and also the wizards used to create both the events and the user profiles.
* Decorations: This module contains some decorations for the app.
* Screens: This module contains the code for all of the screens that appear in the app.

![image uml logical architecture](images/uml-diagram-logical.png)

### Physical architecture

The physical layer in our app consists on the user installing the app on their smartphone which uses firebase as it's database server. In order to communicate with the database our app uses HTTPS requests to be able to retrieve and store all the data needed.

![image uml physical architecture](images/physical-architecture.png)

### Prototype

To help on validating all the architectural, design and technological decisions made, we usually implement a vertical prototype, a thin vertical slice of the system.

In this subsection please describe in more detail which, and how, user(s) story(ies) were implemented.

---

## Implementation

Regular product increments are a good practice of product management.

While not necessary, sometimes it might be useful to explain a few aspects of the code that have the greatest potential to confuse software engineers about how it works. Since the code should speak by itself, try to keep this section as short and simple as possible.

Use cross-links to the code repository and only embed real fragments of code when strictly needed, since they tend to become outdated very soon.

---

## Test

We used the [github issues](https://github.com/FEUP-ESOF-2020-21/open-cx-t4g5-teenage-mutant-coding-turtles/issues) and [project](https://github.com/FEUP-ESOF-2020-21/open-cx-t4g5-teenage-mutant-coding-turtles/projects/1) to organize our project.

Unit Tests are used to verify the expected output after the user interacts with the application and have been implemented using the `flutter_test` dependency.

### Unit Tests

#### Implemented Unit Tests

* User Model to Json

#### Unit Tests to be made

* Interactions in login screen
* Interactions in Register
* Interactions in Profile Creation Screen
* Interactions in Home Screen
* Interactions in Create Event Screen
* Interactions in AppBar
* Interactions in NavBAr
* Event creation
* Event Model to Json
* Sign In
* Sign Out

This unit tests are currently running in a pipeline in commits and PR to the main branch of the repository.

## Configuration and change management

Configuration and change management are key activities to control change to, and maintain the integrity of, a project’s artifacts (code, models, documents).

For the purpose of ESOF, we will use a very simple approach, just to manage feature requests, bug fixes, and improvements, using GitHub issues and following the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

---

## Project management

Software project management is an art and science of planning and leading software projects, in which software projects are planned, implemented, monitored and controlled.

To keep track of all of this the team adopted [Github Projects](https://github.com/FEUP-ESOF-2020-21/open-cx-t4g5-teenage-mutant-coding-turtles/projects/1)!
